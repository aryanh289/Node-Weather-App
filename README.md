# Node-Weather-App

Dynamic live weather forecast application built on all the new web technologies like: 
Node JS for Computation
Express JS For Server
Json for storing data
Weather API for Weather forcast details (1000 API calls/ month)
Handlebars for dynamics
Bootstrap for dynamic and responsive frontend
Ajax
Heroku cloud for deployment

This is just a prototype, so i prefer to use this on desktop screen although it is responsive but the second page is not so responsive.
